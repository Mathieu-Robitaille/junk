DOOM comes to python!
(Except this has probably been done before and better)

This is my implementation of Doom in python.

Future TODOs will reside here if they're more than a 5 minute fix
General game plan will reside here as well.




# TODOs
Build a sprite loader


BONUS FEATURES:
Use maze builder to generate map
Build parser for generated map to level
Allow character to break walls? expanding map further?

BUGS (Ahem... Features)
Renderer currently draws walls out of order some times, Likely a simple fix.
