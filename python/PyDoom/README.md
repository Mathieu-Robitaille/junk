DOOM comes to python!
(Except this has probably been done before and better)

This is my implementation of Doom in python.

Future TODOs will reside here if they're more than a 5 minute fix
General game plan will reside here as well.


# TODOs
Parse string to build map (Done?)
Build edge detection for polygons to get finer resolution of distance to walls
Render said map and have walls drawn accordingly (Rough)
Build mini-map in top left corner for debugging (Done)
Build a sprite loader



BONUS FEATURES:
Use maze builder to generate map
Build parser for generated map to level
Allow character to break walls? expanding map further?
