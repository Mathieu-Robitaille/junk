DOOM comes to python!
(Except this has probably been done before and better)

This is my implementation of Doom in python.

Future TODOs will reside here if they're more than a 5 minute fix
General game plan will reside here as well.


# TODOs
Parse string to build map
Render said map and have walls drawn accordingly
Use maze builder to generate map
Build parser for generated map to level
Build mini-map in top left corner for debugging
Build a sprite loader

MAP MOVEMENT IS MESSED UP RN, High prio
Maybe x, y are flipped?



Future TODOs
Allow character to break walls? expanding map further?
