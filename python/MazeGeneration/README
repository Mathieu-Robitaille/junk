!!! Requires pygame !!!


This is a maze generation and solving set of algorithms.
Initially written as a self challenge to create then solve mazes in one day, it has since grown.

Right now there are A* and flood fill searches, you can use the up and down arrowkeys to alternate between the two.
These happen simultaniously allowing you to view the speed differences.

mazeglobals.py contains all varriables for the generation itself.
